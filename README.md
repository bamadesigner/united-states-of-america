United States of America Counties, Coordinates and More
========================

After having to come up with several states' coordinates, and counties, for a project, I figured there might be others out there who could use this data. I only have a few states right now so bear with me as the project grows and feel free to contribute. All of the data lives here in one big array for you to use and/or contribute to. Each state has the following info:

- Abbreviation
- Label
- Capital
- Capital Coordinates
- Counties
- State Coordinates
- Center of State Coordinates

You can also check out my ["United States of America" custom Google map](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zcT1xEg9PqB4.kUMdbbt8jQjM), where I keep all the coordinates data in a visual format, ready for embedding or export.
