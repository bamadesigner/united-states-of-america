United States of America Counties, Coordinates and More
========================

After having to come up with several states' coordinates, and counties, for a project, I figured there might be others out there who could use this data. All of my data lives here in one big array for you to use and/or contribute to. Each state has the following info:

- Abbreviation
- Label
- Capital
- Counties
- Coordinates (state boundaries)
- Center (coordinate)
